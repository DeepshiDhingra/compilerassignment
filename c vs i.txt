1. It converts HLL program                1. It converts HLL program                
   language into machine                         into machine language line by line
   language in one go

2.all errors report at the end           2.errors report side by side(at the same time)
   after all errors removed the             
   program is recompiled

3.execution time is less                      3.execution time is more


4.produce machine code                     4.it produces intermediate code
 which is directly understood                 after  translation.
